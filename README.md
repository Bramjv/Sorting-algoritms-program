# Sorting-algoritms-program
Program is about sorting random arrays of random lenght between 100-000 and 10-000-000 of random integer or float in range of 0 to 1000 numbers by quick sort, heap sort, radix sort, tim sort, merge sort, bucket sort; after sorting arrays function measure_sort_time is checking how much time sorting algoritm take, and saving outputs to .csv file in order: "Algorithm", "Data Size", "Data Characteristic", "Time (s)" and by matplotlib creating chart how much time each algoritm takes to how many numbers array got.
